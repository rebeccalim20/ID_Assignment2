## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

- Bus stop :
  - It works only when the bus information is available when the bus information is not available the page will not load
  - The page will scale down according to different sizing , the data of the table does not looks nice.
  - Might take more time for the data to load 
- Bus fare  :
  - The page will scale down according to different sizing ,in table form
  - Only consist of bus fare data
- Bus information :
  - only had a few bus data infos 
  - take quite abit for the data to load
